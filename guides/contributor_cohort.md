# Contributor Cohort (In progress)
This guide is a rough step by step of how to run a contributor cohort which consists of notes JV is making as he ran through the first experiment. It is also acting as our road map for the experiment.

## Gather interest
Create a [loomio proposal](https://www.loomio.org/d/dOBMhoJx/contributor-cohort-experiment) for people to opt in to the cohort.

15-30 people is a good starting size as I am expecting some people dropping out or have a low activity. 16 active participants would be the ideal number (8 pairs, 4 quads, 2 octets).

We had 20 participants and 4 hosts opt in and have had 2 extra participants join since the initial invitation.

## Week 0 (November 7)
- start [Loomio group](https://www.loomio.org/g/QsziFDLV/enspiral-contributor-cohort) and invite all the folks who opted in
- checkin: introductions - launch an [Introduction Thread](https://www.loomio.org/d/8QBWh3VM/introductions) with a proposal of 7 days and prompt of 
  - Why did you join Enspiral in the first place?
  - How did you spend most of your time last week?
  - What outcomes would you like from the cohort experiment?
- create a [naming thread](https://www.loomio.org/d/7DXsLidp/challenge-1-what-s-in-a-name) for the cohort to choose its name
  - introduce the concept of [bikeshedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) 
  - introduce [diversity agreement](https://handbook.enspiral.com/diversity_agreement.html)
  - run suggestion proposal for 3 days
  - introduce dot voting
  - run dot voting to choose name for another 3 days
  - rename loomio group and slack channel to cohort name
- launch a slack channel
- launch a doodle poll for best checkin times
- find out timezones everyone is in [trialling a loomio proposal](https://www.loomio.org/d/iOX51jA9)
